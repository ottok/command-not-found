This package uses quilt to manage all modifications to the upstream source.
Please see /usr/share/doc/quilt/README.source for further information.

This source is repackaged from Ubuntu's tarball. Therefore, the ubuntu[1-9]
suffix has been removed from the version number. There is no other upstream
tarball.
